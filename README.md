# SparkPeople (Clone)
SparkPeople is a health and fitness company that offers nutrition advice, health-and-fitness tools, a highly engaged and supportive community, and resources that are 100% free.
Far beyond just weight loss, SparkPeople helps everyone learn to eat better and exercise regularlyâ€”for life.

In this project we have tried our best to make the exact replica of SparkPeople.With the technology stack that we have learnt in masai school we were able to build the front-end of the SparkPeople app.
### Technology Stack we used in building this Project :
- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
